# ml_author_prediction_web_app
Here I have deployed a author recognitin ML app using Flask.

To see it in action go to this url: https://author-prediction-app.herokuapp.com/

This app is trained on Spooky Author Identification dataset from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification/data).
It classifies the authors of the stories in 3 authors: EAP -> (Edgar Allan Poe), HPL -> (HP Lovecraft) and MWS -> (Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley).

Training code and dataset is available here:https://github.com/approjecthub/author-prediction-using-machine-learning-model
